I have used the algorithms and methods discussed in lectures as well as on the beastie website!


The following commands are useful:

make all - compiles everything

Syntax about my language:

function main(){
    var x = 5;
    return;
}
main();

In order to call a function (including main), you have to define it, and then write "functionName();"
to run it.
